Actions that need to happen once, and only once, during an upgrade will create a file in **/var/cpanel/version**. To keep things simple, only the file names are used in the below list. Each can be found in the same **/var/cpanel/version** directory.

Many of the files also exist on a fresh install. For most files, their presence prevents something from happening (e.g. a conversion). These files are usually zero-length in size. If a file contains something, then it is both the presence of the file, and its contents that are important.

File names in bold indicate files researched and explained.

* 2.2
* **6.2**: Created by install/CPanelPost.pm; Contains a time stamp in Unix epoch format. Used by _unknown_
* addons_update/
* **advanced_zone_editor_install**: Created by **install/CPanelPost.pm** during initial installation. Its presence disables the Advanced DNS Editor in cPanel
* api_shell
* **bandwidth**: Contains a version number (currently: 3.3), and a date time of when the version was recorded. Created by **install/Bandwidth.pm**.
* **bandwidth_sqlite_upgrade**: Created by **install/BandwidthSQLiteUpgrade.pm**. Its presence indicates the conversion from the older RRD binary format, to sqlite has occurred.
* **boxtrapper**: Created by **bin/boxtrappermigrate**, it indicates an ancient conversion took place. Legacy. No longer has merit.
